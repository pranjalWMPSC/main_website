							<p class="ptext">Water is the source of life - an essential of all human activities, however, with increasing agriculture, commercialization, rapid population explosion and changing consumption patterns, the need for water, especially clean water, is at all- time high.
                            The Global water industry is one of the most important industries in the world. It not only provides drinking water and waste water services to the global population but also supplies the industrial and agricultural sectors. Pressure on the water industry is expected to increase in the coming years as climate change shrinks water availability worldwide and populations continue to grow.</p>
                            <p class="ptext">There is a huge need to build Human resources for the Water Resources & Plumbing Sectors in India. India has been blessed with a demographic dividend with a potential to reach greater heights. A well trained and motivated manpower is the backbone of any developmental activity. In a hugely diversified field like the water and the plumbing sector.also, there is a pressing need for sustained human resource development through multi - level training of personnel involved in the sectors to undertake the challenges and tasks ahead. The same is being spearheaded by WMPSC.</p>
