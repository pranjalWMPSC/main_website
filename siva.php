Believe it or not, stuff like this motivates everyone to do something, but there are only a few who achieve something. Siva, a 24-year-old plumber from Attibele village of Bangalore took these quotes religiously and what is in front of us today is truly inspirational.</p>										<p class="ptext">Plumbing was never a career option for Siva, at least not till his graduation. And it was just in months when he realized that Plumbing could be a good career option. Siva completed his Bachelor's in Commerce in 2017 and started working as an HR Assistant. After four months of struggle and unwanted pressure, it was pretty much clear to Siva that this HR thing is not going to last for him. “I was done with that job and left that”, says Siva. In a family where both parents had to depend on agriculture to earn the bread for the family, Siva could not have afforded to be unemployed. As a result, Siva had to find a job immediately. In the event of finding a new job, he ended up having a job in L&T as a piping supervisor at a very low salary of Rs. 10000/- per month. This was Siva’s first step in the plumbing industry. Plumbing was now not an alienated work for Siva. During his employment in L&T, he developed an interest in plumbing and wanted to learn more.</p><p class="ptext">Walking on the streets of his village, Siva one day noticed Ashirvad Plumbing School (APS). With a willingness to know more about the school, he entered the same and came to know about the Plumbing Training and Certification program of the Indian Plumbing Skills Council. APS was now a new goal for Siva. After an informal discussion with his brother, Siva decided to get himself enrolled in the Training and in February 2019, he was successfully certified by Indian Plumbing Skills Council.</p><p class="ptext">“Ashirvad Plumbing School provided me with good accommodation and the response from them was very warm. I can’t thank them much for whatever they’ve done for me.”, said Siva when contacted by our team. <strong>“WMPSC came into my life like a new chapter with a lot of success. My income did increase after the certification and now on the behalf of the same certification, I am being able to run my own business as well”</strong>, described Siva to our team.</p><p class="ptext"> Shobha Developers was the first company in which Siva got employed after his certification. This 3-month job came as a morale booster for Siva and he was now ready to go ahead with his own business. “Siva Engineering & Plumbing Works” is the banner under which Siva is now running his business which not only includes Plumbing work but Rain Water Harvesting work as well. What is more fascinating is that the 24-year-old boy is currently giving employment to two other plumbers in his shop. After all the expenses he is currently saving about Rs.25000/- per month. And now wants to develop his name further in the industry.</p><p class="ptext">There are many more “Siva(s)” in the country and to encourage them, the right nurturing and a perfect ecosystem are what is needed. WMPSC has been flawlessly doing the same for the last 7 years. And when we mention that we are doing this from the last 7 years, we just mean that we are the one who can give you the wings to fly, now it’s only up to you how high you fly & how far you fly.</p>																																							</div>									<!--Social Box-->																</div>							</div>						</div>					</div>				</div>														</div>		</div>	</div>		<!--Main Footer-->    <?php include "includes/newsletter.php"; ?>    <!--End Newsleter Section-->	<?php include "includes/footer.php"; ?></body></html>
