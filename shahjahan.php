The journey of Shahjahan from being a plumber to a supervisor was never easy. Until 2018, Shahjahan was a self-employed plumber and had to rely on small works on day to day basis to earn bread for his family, some days were full of business, whereas some used to go vacuous. “Apne kaam mein kabhi aap kamaate ho, kabhi nahin kamaate ho, aur plumbing mein aise kama paana mushkil hai” (In self-employed work, there’s any uncertainty on daily earnings and it’s difficult to survive like this when you’re a plumber), said Shahjahan when asked whether he’s comfortable with self-employed work or a job.</p><p class="ptext">Shahjahan acquired the Indian Plumbing Skills Council Training & Certification in December 2018. That certification proved to be a life-changing achievement for Shahjahan, who was nearly earning fifteen thousand rupees per month before getting trained and certified from WMPSC. The hardworking plumber from Muzaffarnagar attended the biggest event of the plumbing community, Plumbing Skills Moahatsav organized by WMPSC, in February 2019. The event had a career zone where plumbers could get new job opportunities. Shahjahan was among many others who successfully grabbed a job at the event and the rest is history. He first joined Ascon Technologies as a plumber but it was in months when the company identified Shahjahan’s potential and promoted him to the position of Plumbing Supervisor. Now, Shahjahan is earning twenty-five thousand rupees per month and is highly motivated to reach the skies from here.</p><p class="ptext">Shahjahan’s story is one among many other success stories of WMPSC. The organization working under the aegis of National Skill Development Corporation takes pride in the saying that it has, till now, certified nearly one lac plumbers and the count is increasing like anything.</p>																																							</div>									<!--Social Box-->																</div>							</div>						</div>					</div>				</div>														</div>		</div>	</div>		<!--Main Footer-->    <?php include "includes/newsletter.php"; ?>    <!--End Newsleter Section-->	<?php include "includes/footer.php"; ?></body></html>
