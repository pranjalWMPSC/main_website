The skill ecosystem in India, is seeing some great reforms and policy interventions which is reinvigorating and re-energising the country’s workforce today; and is preparing the youth for job and growth opportunities in the international market. The Hon’ble Prime Minister’s flagship scheme, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) alone, has till date seen close to 50 lakh people get skilled and prepared for a new successful India.

							MSDE also recognises and certifies skills acquired through informal means through its Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) program under PMKVY, bringing about a major shift from unorganised sector to an organised economy. So far more than 10 lacs people have been certified and formally recognised under the programs. </p>
